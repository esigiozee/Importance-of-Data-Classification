**Mini-Project 35: Data Classification**

It is important to maintain a complete and connected framework for managing IT assets in the modern information technology management landscape. As we move forward with the technology refresh project and dive deeper into pinpointing the most ideal IT Asset Management (ITAM) solution, a crucial element has emerged which would be the necessity of data classification. This realization came after doing a bit of digging to find that there was a lack of both asset and data classification. 

This document aims to clarify the meaning of data classification, as well as its scope, benefits, how it can help the company from both a cost and compliance perspective, and also how data classification would integrate with the new ITAM solution. Also, it will  propose data classification categories and what they might include. Another important topic to include will be the importance of data retention and how it will be implemented. Lastly, how the destruction of data and documents will work.

Data classification is the process of categorizing data assets based on their information sensitivity. It involves grouping data according to its type, sensitivity, and importance to the organization with the objective to provide an organized method for handling and protecting data assets. By labeling confidential data sets with classification tags like “top secret,” “internal,” or “public,” organizations can consistently apply appropriate cybersecurity controls, access protocols, storage guidelines, and retention policies. 

The scope of data classification includes all digital and, if applicable, physical data owned by the company. It covers a wide range of information, from personal data on employees and customers to confidential company information and property rights.

Organizations that fail to use data classification are more likely to experience data breaches and compliance difficulties. Data classification is vital for developing a strategy for prioritizing data security based on risk and enforcing compliance requirements across internal teams. Here a list of benefits of data classification:



* Better identify your threat risk and improve data protection
* Regain control of your data
* Better meet your data privacy compliance requirements
* Efficiency in data management

	In terms of cost, data classification reduces the financial risks associated with data breaches, which can result in significant fines and negative publicity. Data classification involves tagging data to make it easily searchable and trackable. With that it can also eliminate multiple duplications of data, which can reduce storage and backup costs while speeding up the search process. Classification helps with regulatory compliance and can result in cost savings by applying the proper level of security for all information. By classifying its data, a company may focus its resources on protecting its valuable information through encryption and enhanced security. Lower-risk data can be processed with less expensive methods.

	Regarding compliance, data classification plays an important role in complying with to regulations like the ones below:



* The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): financial records and company governance.
* The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Designed to improve personal data protections of EU residents and increase organizational accountability for data breaches
* Export Controls: Managing access to sensitive data that may be subject to export restrictions.

Compliance with these laws and regulations requires strict data management methods, to which data classification provides a structured solution. 

It is critical to understand that not all data is the same. The following is a data classification strategy that shows some of the most common types of data that organizations and their employees manage on a regular basis:



* Public: Information that can be made public without any repercussions.
* Private: This is mainly personal information that may or may not be protected by law, such as sensitive or non-sensitive personally identifiable information .
* Internal: Data that is sensitive to the company but not critical.
* Confidential: Information that could cause harm if revealed. Would include financial data, personal employee information, or supply chain information.
* Highly confidential: Very important data that if it were to be compromised it could lead to severe financial, reputational, or legal damage. 

	Data retention policies play an important role in determining how long data should be kept based on its classification. Such rules assist in meeting legal obligations and effectively managing storage costs. Data retention is the preservation and usage of data for a predefined period called a data retention period to satisfy business, technical and legal requirements. Data retention ensures that data is easily recoverable in the case of an unforeseen disaster or circumstance that leads to data loss. In order to implement data retention we must create a data retention policy. The process for creating one will vary depending on the type of data is captured and laws and regulations but it would look similar to this:



* Establish your data retention policy development team.
* Sort data into policy categories; you'll need to develop a separate data retention policy for each category.
* Determine which rules and regulations your business is subject to based on data type, location, industry, and so on.
* For every record retention policy:
    * Decide which items will be archived (and for how long), and which will be deleted.
    * Determine who will be responsible for each item category.
    * Create a plan to enforce the policy.
    * Share the policy with all concerned employees and teams.
* Create the policy.
* Update each policy on a regular basis, and make sure to convey any changes to your personnel.

	Document and data destruction is regulated by the data classification and retention policies. Securing the destruction of documents and data that are no longer needed is very important for protecting sensitive information and lowering storage costs.

	

	Integrating data classification into the new ITAM solution could significantly improve asset management capabilities. It offers a single approach to managing both physical and digital assets, ensuring that data handling methods are consistent and in compliance with laws and regulations.

	

Integrating data classification into the technology refresh project is far more than an addition; it is a structural enhancement that corresponds with the strategic goals of cost reduction, compliance adherence, and greater overall efficiency. The proposed data classification framework, in combination with strong data retention and destruction regulations, will considerably improve the company's IT asset management tasks. As a result, it is recommended that data classification should be seen as a crucial part of the ITAM solution deployment, ensuring a comprehensive approach to asset and data management inside the organization.
